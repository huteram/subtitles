1
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,103
When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,109
with a big hole blown through
the middle of my life,

3
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,413
I started having
these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,249
I was free.

5
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:58,048
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

6
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,374
In cryo, you don't
dream at all.

7
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,402
It doesn't feel like 6 years.

8
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,946
More like a 5th of tequila
and an ass-kicking.

9
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,319
Tommy was the scientist,
not me.

10
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,591
He was the one who wanted to
get shot light-years out in space

11
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,990
to find the answers.

12
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,493
Are we there yet?

13
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,360
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

14
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,499
We're there.

15
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,034
It's about your brother.

16
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,502
So, a week before
Tommy's gonna ship out,

17
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,804
a guy with a gun
ends his journey

18
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,276
for the paper in his wallet.

19
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,481
You've been in cryo for 5 years,
9 months and 22 days.

20
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,452
You will be hungry.
You will be weak.

21
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,114
If you feel nausea,
please use the sacks...

22
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,215
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.

23
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,523
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt going
someplace he's gonna regret.

24
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,402
Up ahead was Pandora.

25
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,814
You grew up hearing about it,

26
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,780
but I never figured
I'd be going there.

27
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,227
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,128
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

29
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,793
And since your genome is
identical to his,

30
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,768
you could step into his shoes,

31
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,705
so to speak.

32
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,641
It'd be a fresh start
on a new world.

33
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,990
And the pay is good.

34
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,593
Very good.

35
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,644
Exo-packs on! Let's go!
Exo-packs on!

36
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,878
Exo-packs on! Let's go!

37
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,318
Remember, people,
you lose that mask,

38
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,322
you're unconscious
in 20 seconds,

39
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,085
you're dead in 4 minutes!

40
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,491
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

41
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,957
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

42
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,830
Crossing outer marker.
Mine is in sight.

43
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,405
One life ends,

44
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,599
another begins.

45
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,382
Harnesses off!
Get your packs!

46
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,923
Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
Harnesses off. 1 minute!

47
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,016
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

48
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,653
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

49
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,537
Go, go, go, go!
Get out of there!

50
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,266
Keep moving!
Let's go, let's go!

51
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,870
There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine.

52
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,940
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.

53
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,046
I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass.

54
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,894
They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,

55
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,693
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.

56
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,193
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

57
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,333
Well, well, ladies.

58
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,009
Look at all this fresh meat!

59
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,545
Back on Earth, these guys
were Army dogs, Marines,

60
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,143
fighting for freedom.

61
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,384
Look out, hot rod!

62
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,731
But out here
they're just hired guns,

63
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,666
taking the money,
working for the company.

64
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,134
Check this out, man.

65
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,238
Meals on wheels.

66
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,441
Man, that is just wrong.

67
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,676
I got 2 guys free
in about 20 minutes!

68
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,303
Got it! Need them!

69
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,555
You're not in Kansas anymore.

70
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,895
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

71
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,729
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

72
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,596
If there is a hell,

73
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,671
you might want to go there
for some R&R

74
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,971
after a tour on Pandora.

75
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,006
Out there, beyond that fence,

76
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:59,414
every living thing that crawls,
flies or squats in the mud

77
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,647
wants to kill you and
eat your eyes for Jujubes.

78
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,323
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

79
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,761
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

80
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,628
that'll stop your heart
in one minute.

81
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:19,068
And they have bones reinforced with
naturally occurring carbon fiber.

82
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,502
They are very hard
to kill.

83
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,968
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

84
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,711
I will not succeed.

85
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,284
Not with all of you.

86
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,912
If you wish to survive,

87
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,390
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

88
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,389
You've got to obey the rules.

89
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,165
Pandora rules.

90
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,128
Rule number 1...

91
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,862
There's nothing like
an old-school safety brief

92
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,665
to put your mind at ease.

93
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,509
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Jake!

94
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,545
You're Jake, right?
Tom's brother.

95
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,477
You look just like him.

96
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,551
Sorry, I'm Norm.
Spellman.

97
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,141
I went through avatar training
with him.

98
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,388
...into the bio-lab.

99
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,646
We're gonna spend
a lot of time up here.

100
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,658
Hey! How you doing?
Norm, avatar driver.

101
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,988
Hi.
Hey.

102
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,653
Link... Here's the link room
right here.

103
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,027
This is where we're connecting
to the avatar.

104
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,893
Me and Norm are here to drive

105
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,166
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars.

106
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:32,267
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

107
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,312
Hey. Welcome.
Hey.

108
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,005
Welcome to Pandora.
Good to have you.

109
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,173
Thanks.

110
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,649
Damn! They got big.

111
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,278
Yeah, they fully mature
on the flight out.

112
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,687
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

113
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,656
Yeah, they've got
great muscle tone.

114
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,591
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

115
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,629
but you guys can take them
out tomorrow.

116
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,496
There's yours.

117
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,759
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

118
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,736
Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
Good to meet you, yeah.

119
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,163
Looks like him.

120
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,229
No, it looks like you.

121
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,269
This is your avatar now, Jake.

122
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,908
And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,

123
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,742
so that their nervous systems
are in tune,

124
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,615
or something.

125
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,453
Which is why they
offered me the gig,

126
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,385
because I can link
with Tommy's avatar,

127
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,288
which is insanely expensive.

128
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,529
Is this right? I just say
whatever to the video log?

129
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,757
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

130
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,890
You know, what we see,
what we feel.

131
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,059
It's all part
of the science.

132
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,659
And good science
is good observation.

133
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,170
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next 6 years.

134
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,071
All right.
Whatever.

135
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,370
So...

136
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,179
Well, here I am,

137
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,350
doing science.

138
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,020
They're coming out!

139
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,589
<i>Attention. Drivers coming out of link.</i>

140
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,398
God.

141
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,996
Where's the lab coat?

142
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,799
Who's got my goddamn
cigarette?

143
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,432
Guys! What's wrong
with this picture?

144
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,838
Thank you!

145
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,970
Grace Augustine is a legend.

146
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,571
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

147
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,379
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

148
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,716
Well, that's 'cause she likes
plants better than people.

149
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,119
Here she is,
Cinderella back from the ball.

150
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,886
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

151
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,359
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

152
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,349
Grace?
This is Jake Sully.

153
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,474
Ma'am.

154
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,510
Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are,

155
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,952
and I don't need you.
I need your brother.

156
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,651
You know, the PhD who trained
for 3 years for this mission?

157
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,158
He's dead.

158
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,726
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

159
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,959
How much lab training
have you had?

160
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,631
I dissected a frog once.

161
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,199
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

162
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,433
without even the courtesy of
calling it rain.

163
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,971
I'm going to Selfridge.
No, Grace,

164
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,671
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, man, this is such bullshit!

165
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,178
I'm gonna kick
his corporate butt.

166
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,772
He has no business sticking
his nose in my department.

167
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,951
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

168
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,527
Scorpion 2-Hotel,
Hell's Gate tower.

169
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,122
You are cleared
for south departure.

170
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,067
Hover taxi, Delta runway.
Squawk ident.

171
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:25,176
You see that?
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,336
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

173
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,347
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

174
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,450
Parker, you know, I used to
think it was benign neglect,

175
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,491
but now I see that you're
intentionally screwing me.

176
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,120
Grace, you know,
I enjoy our little talks.

177
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,968
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

178
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,698
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

179
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,296
Lucky?
Yeah.

180
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,398
How is this
in any way lucky?

181
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,239
Lucky your guy
had a twin brother,

182
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,246
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

183
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,242
A Marine we can use.

184
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,181
I'm assigning him to your team
as security escort.

185
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,721
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

186
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,687
Look, look, you're supposed
to be winning the hearts

187
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,815
and the minds
of the natives.

188
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,756
Isn't that the whole point
of your little puppet show?

189
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,327
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

190
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,089
then they'll start trusting us.

191
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,165
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

192
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,257
but after, what,
how many years?

193
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,858
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

194
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,993
Yeah, that tends to happen

195
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,435
when you use
machine guns on them.

196
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,399
Right. Come here.

197
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,238
I can't...
I can't...

198
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,449
This is why we're here.
Unobtanium.

199
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,611
Because this little gray rock
sells for 20 million a kilo.

200
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,917
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

201
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,889
It's what pays
for your science.

202
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,220
Comprendo?

203
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,387
Now, those savages are
threatening our whole operation,

204
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,725
we're on the brink of war,

205
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,029
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

206
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,627
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

207
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,040
So, how much link time
have you logged?

208
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,484
About 520 hours.

209
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,577
That's good.

210
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,586
You're in there.
You're here.

211
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,182
How much have you logged?

212
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,523
Zip. But I read a manual.

213
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,919
Tell me you're joking.

214
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,267
This is cool.

215
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,363
Let's go.

216
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,169
Don't. I got this.

217
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,581
So you just figured
you'd come out here,

218
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,810
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

219
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,320
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

220
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,054
What was going
through your head?

221
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,956
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

222
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,324
Biometrics are good.

223
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,419
Link 3 is ready.

224
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,560
Keep your arms in, hands in,

225
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,166
head down.

226
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,002
Down. Just relax and let
your mind go blank.

227
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,175
That shouldn't be
hard for you.

228
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,507
Kiss the darkest part
of my lily white...

229
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,045
Initiate link.

230
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,315
Run sequence unit 3. Go.

231
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,782
Launching.

232
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,758
I have the first congruency.

233
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,725
That's a gorgeous brain.
Nice activity.

234
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,304
Go figure.

235
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,741
Phase-lock 40%.

236
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,269
All right.
Going in.

237
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,472
I'm going in in 4.

238
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,146
Phase-lock 99%.
Link is stable.

239
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,870
He's in.
Jake, can you hear me?

240
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,874
Can you hear me, Jake?

241
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,534
Pupillary reflex is good.

242
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,747
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

243
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,449
Hey, guys.

244
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,479
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

245
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,519
Good!

246
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,089
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

247
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,284
And touch your thumb
to your fingers. Yeah.

248
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,758
Thumb to your fingers.
No problem.

249
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,419
That's good. I can see
you can remember that one.

250
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,518
Got it.

251
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,654
Well, if you want
to sit up,

252
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,027
that's fine.
Okay, good. Just take it

253
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,259
nice and slow, Jake. Good.

254
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,097
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia,
that's good.

255
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,966
Are you feeling lightheaded
or dizzy at all?

256
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,663
You're wiggling
your toes!

257
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,502
Good. Good, Jake. That's great.

258
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,102
Distal motor control is good.
Good, Jake.

259
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,841
Are you feeling
any numbness or pain?

260
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,381
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

261
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,810
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

262
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,411
There's a few more sensory motor
reflex tests we need to run,

263
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,490
so take it easy.

264
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,580
Wait.

265
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,159
Jake.
Sit down, Jake.

266
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,358
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

267
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,957
I need you to sit down.
Jake! It's okay.

268
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,828
Buddy, listen to me.
It's all good. I got this.

269
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,060
Jake, you need
to sit down right now.

270
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,568
Guys, get him back
on the gurney now.

271
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,763
Listen to me. For your own safety,
you need to sit down.

272
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,671
You need time to adjust
to the avatar... Jake!

273
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:24,765
God, Jake, watch your tail.

274
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,866
Yeah!

275
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:30,172
Sedate! Sedate him!
1,000 milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

276
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,046
Guys! Guys!

277
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,640
By the numbers.

278
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,151
Jake. Come on.
Jake! Listen to me.

279
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,812
You're not used
to your avatar body.

280
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,583
This is dangerous.
This is great.

281
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,921
Jake? Jake, listen to me. Come on.
They're gonna put you out.

282
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,656
Norm, sit down.

283
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,163
No, no. I gotta get
out of these leads.

284
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,824
God damn it!
Bring them home!

285
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,026
Norm! Do not leave control!

286
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,568
You're not ready for it!

287
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,704
Come on,
you ain't got no skills.

288
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,173
So close!

289
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,834
I don't even have
to play defense on it.

290
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,111
Hey, guys. Hey.

291
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,706
It's okay, I'll get him.

292
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,803
Jake, you have to come back!

293
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,678
Jake! Jake!
Excuse me.

294
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,810
Watch it!
Sorry!

295
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,353
Come on!

296
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,323
Jake! We're not supposed
to be running!

297
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,130
Jeez! Sorry.

298
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,261
Watch it!

299
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,050
Hey, Marine!

300
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,294
Damn.

301
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,526
Grace?

302
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,499
Well, who'd you
expect, numbnuts?

303
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,260
Think fast.

304
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,267
Motor control's
looking good.

305
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,244
Come on, everybody,
quiet down!

306
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,481
All right, gang, lights out.

307
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,680
Come on, Louise,
chop-chop.

308
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,224
Hey, hey, hey!

309
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,955
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

310
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,529
That's kind of freaky.

311
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,724
Come on. Scat.

312
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,262
Good night.

313
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,265
Lights out!
See you at dinner, kiddies.

314
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,288
Welcome back.

315
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,331
You okay? You all right?

316
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,635
Yeah, I'm okay.

317
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,310
I'm Trudy.
I fly all the science sorties.

318
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,610
And this here is my baby.

319
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,842
Hold on a second.

320
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,286
Hey, Wainfleet!
Get it done!

321
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,949
We bounce at zero-nine.

322
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,854
Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

323
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,528
Vine strike's still loose.

324
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,790
You guys are packing
some heavy gear.

325
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,229
Watch it!

326
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,528
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the
only thing flying around out there.

327
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,297
Or the biggest.

328
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,202
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

329
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,104
I thought you'd never ask.

330
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,605
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

331
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,724
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

332
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,421
This low gravity'll make you soft.

333
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,387
You get soft,

334
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,934
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

335
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,565
I pulled your record, Corporal.

336
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,076
Venezuela, that was
some mean bush.

337
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,344
Nothing like this here, though.

338
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,778
You got some heart, kid,

339
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,148
showing up in this neighborhood.

340
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,953
I figured it's just another hellhole.

341
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,457
I was First Recon myself.

342
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,756
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

343
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,631
3 tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

344
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,166
I come out here?

345
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,233
Day 1. Think I felt like
a shavetail louie?

346
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,867
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

347
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,841
Yeah, and make me
pretty again.

348
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,642
But you know what?
I kind of like it.

349
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,582
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

350
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,588
Hup! The Avatar Program
is a bad joke.

351
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,491
Bunch of limp-dick
science majors.

352
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,402
However,
it does present an opportunity

353
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,202
both timely

354
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:17,261
and unique. Clear!
Clear!

355
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,572
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.

356
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,572
That's a potent mix.

357
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,306
Give me the goose bumps.

358
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,815
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

359
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,613
right on the ground.

360
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,286
Right in
the hostiles' camp.

361
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,009
Look, Sully. I want you to

362
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,959
learn these savages from the inside.

363
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,723
I want you to gain their trust.

364
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,560
I need to know how to force
their cooperation

365
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,157
or hammer them hard
if they won't.

366
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,728
Am I still
with Augustine?

367
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:53,896
On paper.

368
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:58,101
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

369
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,202
but you report to me.

370
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,636
Can you do that
for me, son?

371
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,349
Hell, yeah, sir.

372
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,049
Well, all right, then.

373
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,966
Son, I take care of my own.

374
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,161
You get me what I need,

375
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,034
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

376
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,875
Your real legs.

377
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,637
That sounds real good, sir.

378
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,685
Link's ready!

379
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,017
Phase-lock 40%.

380
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,717
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

381
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,354
I have 5 congruencies.
Phase-lock 90%.

382
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,761
Link 3 ready.

383
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,093
All right, I'm going in.

384
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,470
Shut it down.
We're gonna stay a while.

385
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,138
Norm! Your pack.

386
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,704
Pack.

387
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,784
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

388
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,450
You the man, Doc.

389
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,121
Prolemuris.
They're not aggressive.

390
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:12,225
Relax, Marine.
You're making me nervous.

391
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,369
So, how will
they know we're here?

392
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,140
I'm sure they're
watching us right now.

393
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,450
Keep moving, Norm.

394
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,779
Keep up, guys!

395
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,216
And here I go.

396
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,553
Scanning.

397
00:26:37,194 --> 00:26:39,157
It's that fast?

398
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,292
Amazing, isn't it?

399
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,492
Yeah.

400
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,368
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

401
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,201
to the root of
the tree next to it.

402
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,070
So, we should
take a sample.

403
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,837
Okay. Sample.

404
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,576
You know, it's probably electrical,

405
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,081
based on the speed
of the reaction.

406
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,720
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

407
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,952
Right.

408
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,716
So, here I go.

409
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:04,639
Don't shoot. Don't shoot,
you'll piss him off.

410
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,278
It's already pissed off.

411
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,219
Jake, that armor's too thick.

412
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,347
Trust me.

413
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,788
It's a territorial threat display.

414
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,333
Do not run, or he'll charge.

415
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,731
So, what do I do,
dance with it?

416
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,671
Just hold your ground.

417
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,754
Yeah? Come on!
What you got?

418
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,860
Yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

419
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,261
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, bitch.

420
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,858
That's right, get your punk ass
back to mommy.

421
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,403
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

422
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,769
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends?

423
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,703
Shit.

424
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,991
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

425
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,452
Run! Definitely run!

426
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,252
I'm gonna have
to call it, guys.

427
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,225
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

428
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,430
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna
have to hang on till morning.

429
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,890
He won't make it till morning.

430
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,781
I don't have
all goddamn night.

431
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,708
Come on!
Come on!

432
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,283
Hey, wait. Don't!

433
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,922
Great.

434
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,948
Look, I know you probably
don't understand this,

435
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,259
but thank you.

436
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,632
Thank you.

437
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,311
That was
pretty impressive.

438
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,982
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was...

439
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,648
Hey, wait a second.
Hey, where you going?

440
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,125
Wait up!

441
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,657
Just... Hey, slow down.

442
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,493
Look, wait up, I just wanted to
say thanks for killing those things.

443
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,025
Damn!

444
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,925
Don't thank.

445
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,203
You don't thank
for this.

446
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,710
This is sad.
Very sad only.

447
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,739
Okay. Okay.
I'm sorry.

448
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,379
Whatever I did,
I am sorry.

449
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:47,049
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

450
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,983
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

451
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,152
Your fault!

452
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,592
Your fault!

453
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:54,926
Easy. Easy.

454
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,695
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

455
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,812
Easy.

456
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,906
Fine. Fine.

457
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,202
If you love your little
forest friends,

458
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,611
why not let them
just kill my ass?

459
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,379
What's the thinking?

460
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,186
Why save you?

461
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,879
Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

462
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,294
You have a strong heart.

463
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,624
No fear.

464
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:35,002
But stupid!
Ignorant like a child.

465
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,845
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

466
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,709
Look, maybe you should
teach me.

467
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,012
Sky People cannot learn.
You do not See.

468
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,951
Well, then teach me
how to See.

469
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,647
No one can teach you to See.

470
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,326
Look, come on, can't we talk?

471
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,229
Say, where'd you learn
to speak English?

472
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,162
Dr. Augustine's school?

473
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,699
You're like a baby.

474
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,504
I need your help.

475
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,446
You should not be here.

476
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,385
Okay, take me with you.

477
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,214
No! Go back.

478
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,456
No.

479
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,653
Go back.

480
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,304
No!

481
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,298
What...

482
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,576
What are they?

483
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,914
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

484
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,609
Very pure spirits.

485
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:51,867
What was that all about?

486
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,870
Come.

487
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,406
Come!

488
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,346
Where are we going?

489
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,621
Come.

490
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,997
What's your name?

491
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,162
Shit!

492
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:47,755
Okay.

493
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,131
What's going on?

494
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,159
Wait.

495
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,764
What's happening?

496
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,530
Hey!

497
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,507
What's he saying?

498
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,378
Hey, what's he saying?

499
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,279
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

500
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,453
Your father.
It's nice to meet you, sir.

501
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,496
That is Mother.

502
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,559
She is Tsahik. The one
who interprets the will of Eywa.

503
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,769
Who's Eywa?

504
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,375
What are you called?

505
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,680
Jake Sully.

506
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,458
Why did you
come to us?

507
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:06,654
I came to learn.

508
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,733
We have tried to teach other
Sky People.

509
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:14,167
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

510
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,970
Well, my cup is empty,
trust me.

511
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,871
Just ask Dr. Augustine.
I'm no scientist.

512
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,412
What are you?

513
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,879
I was a Marine. A...

514
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,881
A warrior of
the Jarhead clan.

515
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:07,283
It is decided. My daughter
will teach you our ways.

516
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,952
Learn well,
Jakesully.

517
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:15,561
Then we will see if your insanity
can be cured.

518
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:35,751
Good evening.

519
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,551
Please don't get up.

520
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:43,756
Excuse me.

521
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,188
Sorry.

522
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,062
Hey, how you doing?

523
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:38,043
Jake. Jake!
He's in alpha.

524
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,446
He's coming out
right now.

525
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,642
Jake. Jake!

526
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,784
Come on back, kid.
Come on. That's it.

527
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,386
There you go.
There you go.

528
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,860
You're okay.
You're okay.

529
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,557
Damn! You were
dug in like a tick.

530
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,561
Is the avatar safe?

531
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,660
Yeah, Doc.

532
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,766
And you are not
gonna believe where I am.

533
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,345
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

534
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,473
disappearing into the brush with
this angry thanator coming after him.

535
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,107
Hey, it's not something
you can teach.

536
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,549
That is awesome.

537
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,951
You know, for reasons
I cannot fathom,

538
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,957
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

539
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:24,816
"Jarhead clan"?

540
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,964
And it worked?

541
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,122
Hey, I'm practically family.

542
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:34,335
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

543
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:35,996
That's called
taking the initiative, son.

544
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,368
I wish I had 10 more like you.

545
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,600
Look, Sully. Sully.

546
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:42,110
Just find out what
the blue monkeys want.

547
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:48,647
You know, I mean, we try to give
them medicine, education, roads.

548
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,549
But no, no, they like mud.

549
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:54,590
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're...

550
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,618
Hey, can you...
Can somebody just... Sector 12.

551
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,158
Okay, go, go, go,
stop. Stop...

552
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,393
Rich, stop!
That's... Jesus!

553
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,106
Their damn village

554
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:11,566
happens to be resting on
the richest unobtanium deposit

555
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,405
within 200 klicks in any direction.

556
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,002
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

557
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,217
Well, who gets them to move?

558
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,343
Guess.

559
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,553
What if they won't go?

560
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:29,147
I'm betting that they will.

561
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,921
Okay, okay, hey.
Look. Look.

562
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,629
Killing the indigenous
looks bad,

563
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:39,463
but there's one thing that
shareholders hate more than bad press,

564
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,332
and that's a bad
quarterly statement.

565
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,735
I didn't make
up the rules.

566
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:46,002
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

567
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,837
otherwise it's gonna
have to be all stick. Okay?

568
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,746
You got 3 months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

569
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,219
Well, we're wasting time.

570
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,278
I like this guy.

571
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,489
Guys, right now...

572
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,921
Okay, let's run through them again.

573
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,323
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

574
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,331
Eytucan. Eytukan.
He's the clan leader.

575
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,367
But she's the spiritual leader.

576
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,560
Like a shaman.

577
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,227
Got it.

578
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,361
T'su'tey.

579
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,530
Tsu'tey.

580
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,629
Tsu'tey.

581
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,368
He'll be the next clan leader.

582
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,378
Neytiri.

583
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:23,844
She'll be the next Tsahik.

584
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,915
They become a mated pair.

585
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:27,939
So who's this Eywa?

586
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,243
Who's Eywa?

587
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,748
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

588
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,188
Everything they know!

589
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,385
You'd know this if you had
any training whatsoever.

590
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,825
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

591
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,590
Come on. That's...
All right, knock it off, you two.

592
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,188
Let's go.
Village life starts early.

593
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,903
Don't do anything
unusually stupid.

594
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,254
Easy, boy.

595
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,951
Pale is female.

596
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,330
Okay. Easy, girl.

597
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,959
That is tsaheylu.
The bond.

598
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,295
Feel her.

599
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:59,533
Feel her heartbeat.
Her breath.

600
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,342
Feel her strong legs.

601
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,148
You may tell her what to do.

602
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,412
Inside.

603
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,322
For now, say where to go.

604
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,554
Forward!

605
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,805
You should go away.

606
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:39,270
No, you'd miss me.

607
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,411
I knew you could speak English.

608
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,395
Again.

609
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:03,836
If you want to hit this thing,

610
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,931
it's gonna be complicated.

611
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,510
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

612
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,337
There's an outer row of columns.

613
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,477
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

614
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,709
and an inner ring.

615
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:17,184
There's a core structure
like a spiral.

616
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,680
That's how they move
up and down.

617
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,622
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

618
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:23,693
Roger that.

619
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,355
What else can you tell us about
the structure?

620
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,660
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

621
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,296
So where are we going?

622
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,703
Getting out of Dodge.

623
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,239
I'm not about to let Selfridge and
Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

624
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,577
There's a mobile link up at Site 26
we can work out of,

625
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,617
way up in the mountains.

626
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,978
The Hallelujah Mountains?

627
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,755
That's right.

628
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,050
Are you serious?

629
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,146
Yeah.

630
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,247
Yes!

631
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,996
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora.

632
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,224
Heard of them?

633
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,611
We're getting close.

634
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,615
Yeah, look at my instruments.

635
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,386
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

636
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,717
We're VFR from here on.

637
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,688
What's VFR?

638
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,124
Means you gotta see
where you're going.

639
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:32,660
You can't see anything.

640
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,128
Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

641
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,244
My God.

642
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,591
You should see your faces.

643
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,417
Thank you for
flying Air Pandora.

644
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,371
Welcome to camp.

645
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,517
So, this is my bunk.

646
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:06,884
This stuff is nasty.

647
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,215
Norm, go under.
All right.

648
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,384
Grace didn't miss a thing.

649
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,792
Trudy, you'll take the top one.

650
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:16,297
She knew I was talking
to the Colonel.

651
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:19,994
But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

652
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,695
so she's playing nice.

653
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:25,297
All right. Jake, hang a left.

654
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:26,841
You'll be in the link at the end.

655
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:33,806
Unit 1. Beulah.
She's the least glitchy.

656
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,363
Holy shit!

657
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:26,529
Do not look in her eye.

658
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,440
Ikran is not horse.

659
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,446
Once tsaheylu is made,

660
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:48,654
ikran will fly with only 1 hunter
in the whole life.

661
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,331
To become taronyu,
hunter,

662
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:04,998
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you.

663
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,568
When?
When you are ready.

664
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:03,130
Okay. This is video log 12.

665
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,001
Time's 2132.

666
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:08,670
Do I have to do this now?

667
01:00:08,777 --> 01:00:10,802
I really need to
get some rack.

668
01:00:10,913 --> 01:00:13,746
No, now.
When it's fresh.

669
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:18,249
Okay, location, shack,

670
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:21,553
and the days are starting
to blur together.

671
01:00:24,026 --> 01:00:26,859
The language is a pain,
but, you know,

672
01:00:26,962 --> 01:00:28,725
I figure it's like
field-stripping a weapon.

673
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:30,128
Just repetition, repetition.

674
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:31,824
Navi.
"Nari."

675
01:00:31,934 --> 01:00:32,958
Nari.

676
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:34,169
"Narrri"!

677
01:00:34,269 --> 01:00:35,497
Narrri!

678
01:00:36,472 --> 01:00:38,463
Txur ně'ul.
Stronger.

679
01:00:43,112 --> 01:00:46,741
Neytiri calls me skxawng.
It means moron.

680
01:00:49,084 --> 01:00:50,517
This is a very important
part of it.

681
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:51,643
Norm's attitude
has improved lately.

682
01:00:51,754 --> 01:00:52,743
I see you. I see you.

683
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:55,187
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

684
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:56,917
it's "I see into you.
I See you."

685
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:58,015
It's good he's back on board,

686
01:00:58,127 --> 01:00:59,651
but he thinks
I'm a skxawng, too.

687
01:00:59,762 --> 01:01:00,888
"I'm accepting you.
I understand you."

688
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:01,985
So you gotta
get this, okay?

689
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:05,299
I gotta run! Okay?
Let's go.

690
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:09,662
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day.

691
01:01:11,573 --> 01:01:14,667
I have to trust my body
to know what to do.

692
01:01:19,815 --> 01:01:21,510
Yeah! Check it out!

693
01:01:22,084 --> 01:01:23,073
Crap!

694
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,324
Every day it's reading the trails,

695
01:01:30,426 --> 01:01:32,724
the tracks at the waterhole,

696
01:01:32,828 --> 01:01:35,023
the tiniest scents and sounds.

697
01:01:40,602 --> 01:01:45,369
She's always going on about the
flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

698
01:01:46,175 --> 01:01:48,837
I really hope this tree-hugger
crap isn't on the final.

699
01:01:48,944 --> 01:01:52,573
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know.

700
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:55,343
You need to listen
to what she says.

701
01:01:55,451 --> 01:01:58,579
Try to see the forest
through her eyes.

702
01:01:58,687 --> 01:02:01,247
Excuse me.
This is my video log here.

703
01:02:16,672 --> 01:02:19,232
With Neytiri,
it's learn fast or die.

704
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:22,635
You gotta be kidding me.

705
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:53,775
I talked Mo'at into letting
Grace into the village.

706
01:02:56,612 --> 01:02:57,544
It's the first time since
her school was closed down.

707
01:03:01,116 --> 01:03:03,414
No, you don't.
Come back here.

708
01:03:05,687 --> 01:03:06,711
Bon appétit.

709
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,874
Come on, Marine.

710
01:04:01,143 --> 01:04:03,805
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

711
01:04:03,912 --> 01:04:06,107
the people have
to the forest.

712
01:04:06,615 --> 01:04:09,413
She talks about
a network of energy

713
01:04:10,252 --> 01:04:12,812
that flows through
all living things.

714
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:17,021
She says all energy
is only borrowed,

715
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,520
and one day you have
to give it back.

716
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:05,038
A clean kill.

717
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,877
You are ready.

718
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:38,904
Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,

719
01:05:39,007 --> 01:05:41,567
is the test every
young hunter has to pass.

720
01:05:43,812 --> 01:05:47,111
But to do that, you gotta go
where the banshees are.

721
01:06:20,682 --> 01:06:21,910
Now what?

722
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,874
Jakesully will go first.

723
01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:30,734
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside.

724
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,615
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

725
01:08:34,716 --> 01:08:37,514
You will have one chance, Jake.

726
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:39,746
How will I know
if he chooses me?

727
01:08:39,855 --> 01:08:41,789
He will try to kill you.

728
01:08:42,991 --> 01:08:44,356
Outstanding.

729
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:21,288
Make the bond!

730
01:10:24,726 --> 01:10:25,715
No!

731
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:30,789
Jake!

732
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:46,437
Tsaheylu, Jake.

733
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:50,078
Tsaheylu!

734
01:11:00,228 --> 01:11:01,286
Stop!

735
01:11:09,971 --> 01:11:14,534
Yeah, that's right.
You're mine.

736
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:31,191
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

737
01:11:32,861 --> 01:11:33,953
Think, "Fly!"

738
01:11:34,095 --> 01:11:35,062
Fly?

739
01:11:43,538 --> 01:11:44,766
God damn!

740
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,438
Shit!

741
01:12:00,055 --> 01:12:02,216
Shut up and fly straight!

742
01:12:12,334 --> 01:12:14,632
That's it.
Bank left!

743
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:25,741
Level out!
That's it.

744
01:12:31,452 --> 01:12:32,549
Jakesully!

745
01:12:57,379 --> 01:12:58,403
Hey!

746
01:13:04,486 --> 01:13:05,748
Let's go!

747
01:13:18,233 --> 01:13:19,666
Yeah, baby, I got this!

748
01:13:21,169 --> 01:13:22,197
Shit!

749
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:29,542
I may not be
much of a horse guy,

750
01:13:29,644 --> 01:13:31,009
but I was born to do this.

751
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:32,704
Yeah!

752
01:13:34,182 --> 01:13:37,242
I came like this.
This you. Yeah, yeah.

753
01:13:37,352 --> 01:13:40,219
I turn. I feel the wind.
I turn very strong.

754
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:42,312
Look, yeah, see,
I banked so hard...

755
01:14:44,419 --> 01:14:46,387
The Tree of Souls.

756
01:14:49,824 --> 01:14:51,985
It's their most sacred place.

757
01:14:52,794 --> 01:14:55,592
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

758
01:14:55,697 --> 01:14:57,756
Yeah, that's what messes up
my instruments.

759
01:14:57,866 --> 01:15:02,394
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

760
01:15:03,805 --> 01:15:05,864
I would die to get samples.

761
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:08,203
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

762
01:15:09,377 --> 01:15:10,708
You lucky swine.

763
01:15:18,051 --> 01:15:21,748
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.

764
01:15:23,156 --> 01:15:26,125
Only problem is,
you're not the only one.

765
01:15:30,063 --> 01:15:31,121
Dive!

766
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,080
Go, go!

767
01:16:03,296 --> 01:16:04,593
Follow me!

768
01:16:51,077 --> 01:16:53,637
Our guys call it
a Great Leonopteryx.

769
01:16:54,547 --> 01:16:55,809
It is Toruk.

770
01:16:56,616 --> 01:16:57,640
Last Shadow.

771
01:16:59,352 --> 01:17:02,446
Yeah, right.
It's the last one you ever see.

772
01:17:07,093 --> 01:17:10,824
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto.

773
01:17:11,531 --> 01:17:13,294
Rider of Last Shadow.

774
01:17:14,701 --> 01:17:16,134
He rode this?

775
01:17:17,804 --> 01:17:19,362
Toruk chose him.

776
01:17:19,772 --> 01:17:23,606
It has only happened 5 times
since the time of the First Songs.

777
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:24,836
That's a long time.

778
01:17:24,944 --> 01:17:25,968
Yes.

779
01:17:26,412 --> 01:17:28,277
Toruk Macto was mighty.

780
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,880
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

781
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:36,285
All Na'vi people know the story.

782
01:17:43,029 --> 01:17:45,657
Everything is backwards now.

783
01:17:45,765 --> 01:17:47,596
Like out there is the true world

784
01:17:48,368 --> 01:17:50,336
and in here is the dream.

785
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:13,519
It's hard to believe
it's only been 3 months.

786
01:18:16,629 --> 01:18:19,029
I can barely remember
my old life.

787
01:18:22,602 --> 01:18:24,433
I don't know who I am anymore.

788
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:46,021
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

789
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:52,130
Your last report was
more than 2 weeks ago.

790
01:18:54,367 --> 01:18:56,835
I'm starting to doubt
your resolve!

791
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:01,930
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

792
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,872
No, I can do this.

793
01:19:03,977 --> 01:19:05,569
You already have.

794
01:19:06,546 --> 01:19:08,741
You give me good, usable intel.

795
01:19:08,848 --> 01:19:11,009
This Tree of Souls place.

796
01:19:11,484 --> 01:19:13,349
Yeah, I got them
by the balls with that

797
01:19:13,453 --> 01:19:14,852
when this turns
into a shit fight,

798
01:19:14,954 --> 01:19:16,683
which it will. Yeah.

799
01:19:17,657 --> 01:19:19,625
Now it's time
to come in.

800
01:19:21,127 --> 01:19:22,992
By the way,

801
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:25,497
you gonna get
your legs back.

802
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:29,960
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

803
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,503
Gonna have you
on a shuttle tonight.

804
01:19:32,605 --> 01:19:34,368
I'm a man of my word.

805
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,039
I gotta finish this.

806
01:19:41,347 --> 01:19:42,871
There's one more thing.

807
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:48,553
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

808
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,183
If I do it, I'm one of them.

809
01:19:54,694 --> 01:19:56,457
And they'll trust me.

810
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:03,296
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

811
01:20:16,949 --> 01:20:19,417
Well, then, you'd better
get it done, Corporal.

812
01:20:36,869 --> 01:20:40,828
The Na'vi say that
every person is born twice.

813
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,409
The second time

814
01:20:44,705 --> 01:20:48,679
is when you earn your place
among The People forever.

815
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:50,843
Come. Come.

816
01:22:08,494 --> 01:22:11,190
This is a place for prayers
to be heard.

817
01:22:12,832 --> 01:22:14,697
And sometimes answered.

818
01:22:22,575 --> 01:22:25,237
We call these trees
Utraya Mokri.

819
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:27,974
The Tree of Voices.

820
01:22:30,082 --> 01:22:32,141
The voices of our ancestors.

821
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,758
I can hear them.

822
01:22:53,739 --> 01:22:55,297
They live, Jake,

823
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,775
within Eywa.

824
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:04,813
You are Omaticaya now.

825
01:23:05,585 --> 01:23:08,645
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

826
01:23:14,293 --> 01:23:16,352
And you may
choose a woman.

827
01:23:18,531 --> 01:23:20,465
We have many
fine women.

828
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:23,669
Ninat is the best singer.

829
01:23:26,572 --> 01:23:28,437
But I don't want Ninat.

830
01:23:32,778 --> 01:23:34,712
Peyral is a good hunter.

831
01:23:36,415 --> 01:23:38,315
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

832
01:23:40,586 --> 01:23:42,315
I've already chosen.

833
01:23:45,858 --> 01:23:48,326
But this woman must
also choose me.

834
01:23:52,365 --> 01:23:53,923
She already has.

835
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:26,464
I am with you now, Jake.

836
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:29,898
We are mated for life.

837
01:24:36,275 --> 01:24:38,266
What the hell
are you doing, Jake?

838
01:25:08,774 --> 01:25:09,866
Ma Jake!

839
01:25:09,976 --> 01:25:11,238
Don't forget your phase integration.

840
01:25:11,344 --> 01:25:12,675
Jake! No, no, the middle button.

841
01:25:12,778 --> 01:25:14,643
You gotta eat something.
Yeah, there you go.

842
01:25:23,122 --> 01:25:28,059
Jake! Jake. Wake up!
Jake, please!

843
01:25:28,728 --> 01:25:30,593
Don't make me
force-feed a cripple.

844
01:25:30,696 --> 01:25:33,597
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

845
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:38,828
Jake!

846
01:25:47,813 --> 01:25:48,871
Okay.

847
01:25:59,992 --> 01:26:01,983
Here. I'm done.
Let's go.

848
01:26:02,094 --> 01:26:04,324
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

849
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:05,419
I don't need a shower.

850
01:26:05,531 --> 01:26:06,589
Jesus, Marine.

851
01:26:10,636 --> 01:26:11,864
Jake!

852
01:26:18,678 --> 01:26:23,615
Jake! Wake up!
Jake! Wake up!

853
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:28,416
Hey!

854
01:26:29,155 --> 01:26:31,555
Stop! Stop!

855
01:26:31,657 --> 01:26:32,624
Jake!

856
01:26:32,725 --> 01:26:34,420
Go back, stop!

857
01:26:38,664 --> 01:26:39,961
Hey, boss.

858
01:26:40,466 --> 01:26:41,626
Hey!

859
01:26:44,236 --> 01:26:45,294
What?
I got a native

860
01:26:45,404 --> 01:26:48,339
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

861
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:50,705
Well, keep going.
He'll move.

862
01:26:51,644 --> 01:26:54,875
These people have to learn that
we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

863
01:26:57,249 --> 01:26:59,410
Stop! Hey!

864
01:26:59,552 --> 01:27:01,816
Go! Go!

865
01:27:02,855 --> 01:27:04,254
There, see?
He moved.

866
01:27:16,669 --> 01:27:18,398
Dude, dude!
Dude, no!

867
01:27:18,804 --> 01:27:20,062
I'm blind.

868
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:33,577
Jake!

869
01:27:33,686 --> 01:27:34,710
Neytiri!

870
01:27:36,322 --> 01:27:37,949
Here, come on!

871
01:28:02,915 --> 01:28:05,440
Freeze it right there.

872
01:28:07,052 --> 01:28:09,486
Scale up.
Enhance.

873
01:28:11,157 --> 01:28:12,647
Son of a bitch.

874
01:28:14,193 --> 01:28:15,626
Unbelievable.

875
01:28:16,729 --> 01:28:17,718
Get me a pilot.

876
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:18,819
Yes, sir.

877
01:28:39,485 --> 01:28:41,077
You do not speak here!

878
01:28:51,897 --> 01:28:54,024
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

879
01:28:57,203 --> 01:28:58,693
You! Listen. Brother...

880
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:05,871
You mated with this woman?

881
01:29:06,145 --> 01:29:07,203
Shit.

882
01:29:08,647 --> 01:29:10,581
Is this true?

883
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:15,314
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

884
01:29:16,722 --> 01:29:17,848
Brother, please.

885
01:29:17,957 --> 01:29:20,084
Do not attack the Sky People.

886
01:29:20,192 --> 01:29:21,716
Many Omaticaya
will die if you do.

887
01:29:21,827 --> 01:29:23,658
You are not my brother!

888
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:29,062
And I am not your enemy!

889
01:29:30,736 --> 01:29:33,569
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

890
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,604
Go! Go! Go!

891
01:29:40,846 --> 01:29:41,813
I can talk to them.

892
01:29:41,914 --> 01:29:43,279
No more talk.

893
01:29:43,382 --> 01:29:44,747
Tsu'tey!

894
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:53,891
I am Omaticaya.
I am one of you.

895
01:29:54,727 --> 01:29:56,922
And I have the right to speak.

896
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:13,369
The words are like stones
in my heart.

897
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,650
Sir, I'm sorry. No! Hold on!

898
01:30:19,752 --> 01:30:21,982
You can't interrupt
a link in progress!

899
01:30:23,188 --> 01:30:24,519
It's very dangerous!

900
01:30:27,159 --> 01:30:28,285
Grace!

901
01:30:29,561 --> 01:30:30,721
No.

902
01:30:30,963 --> 01:30:32,487
Wait!
Stay down, sir.

903
01:30:34,466 --> 01:30:36,696
Okay. Look...

904
01:30:37,803 --> 01:30:39,100
I was sent here to...

905
01:31:06,699 --> 01:31:08,166
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

906
01:31:08,267 --> 01:31:10,064
You crossed the line.

907
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:15,666
Wheel this meat
out of here.

908
01:31:17,443 --> 01:31:19,934
Jake! What the hell
is going on here?

909
01:31:23,215 --> 01:31:24,978
You let me down, son.

910
01:31:26,986 --> 01:31:28,214
So, what,

911
01:31:29,755 --> 01:31:31,723
you find yourself
some local tail

912
01:31:31,824 --> 01:31:34,987
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

913
01:31:35,094 --> 01:31:37,585
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

914
01:31:37,696 --> 01:31:39,527
Parker...
Shut your pie hole!

915
01:31:40,299 --> 01:31:44,463
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

916
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:45,935
I could do that.

917
01:31:46,038 --> 01:31:47,300
You need to muzzle your dog.

918
01:31:47,406 --> 01:31:48,668
Yeah, can we just take this down

919
01:31:48,774 --> 01:31:50,139
a couple of notches, please?

920
01:31:50,242 --> 01:31:52,710
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

921
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:54,802
You start by
listening to her.

922
01:31:54,913 --> 01:31:57,177
Those trees were sacred to
the Omaticaya

923
01:31:57,282 --> 01:31:59,045
in a way you can't imagine.
You know what?

924
01:31:59,151 --> 01:32:01,415
You throw a stick
in the air around here,

925
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,489
it's gonna land
on some sacred fern,

926
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:05,921
for Christ's sake! I'm not talking

927
01:32:06,025 --> 01:32:08,926
about some kind of pagan
voodoo here.

928
01:32:09,028 --> 01:32:10,427
I'm talking about
something real,

929
01:32:10,529 --> 01:32:13,157
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

930
01:32:13,265 --> 01:32:14,732
Which is what, exactly?

931
01:32:15,801 --> 01:32:17,098
What we think we know

932
01:32:17,202 --> 01:32:20,569
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

933
01:32:20,672 --> 01:32:22,697
between the roots
of the trees,

934
01:32:22,808 --> 01:32:25,038
like the synapses
between neurons.

935
01:32:25,144 --> 01:32:29,706
And each tree has 10-to-the-4th
connections to the trees around it.

936
01:32:29,815 --> 01:32:32,750
And there are 10-to-the-12th
trees on Pandora.

937
01:32:33,886 --> 01:32:35,478
Which is a lot,
I'm guessing.

938
01:32:36,221 --> 01:32:38,587
It's more connections
than the human brain.

939
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:42,283
Get it?
It's a network.

940
01:32:42,394 --> 01:32:45,386
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

941
01:32:45,497 --> 01:32:48,955
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

942
01:32:49,068 --> 01:32:51,764
At sites like the one
you just destroyed.

943
01:32:52,404 --> 01:32:53,428
Yes!

944
01:32:54,673 --> 01:32:58,109
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

945
01:32:59,445 --> 01:33:01,504
They're just goddamn trees!

946
01:33:03,282 --> 01:33:04,613
You need to wake up, Parker.

947
01:33:04,716 --> 01:33:05,978
No. You need to wake up.

948
01:33:06,085 --> 01:33:10,545
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

949
01:33:10,656 --> 01:33:14,353
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

950
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:16,860
If you want to share
this world with them,

951
01:33:16,962 --> 01:33:18,725
you need to
understand them.

952
01:33:18,831 --> 01:33:23,495
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

953
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:27,704
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

954
01:33:27,806 --> 01:33:30,001
They're not gonna
give up their home.

955
01:33:31,844 --> 01:33:33,471
They're not gonna
make a deal.

956
01:33:34,546 --> 01:33:37,344
For what? Lite beer?

957
01:33:37,449 --> 01:33:38,939
And blue jeans?

958
01:33:42,221 --> 01:33:45,088
There's nothing that we have
that they want.

959
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:50,017
Everything they sent me out here
to do is a waste of time.

960
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,865
They're never gonna
leave Hometree.

961
01:33:59,304 --> 01:34:03,001
So, since a deal
can't be made,

962
01:34:03,108 --> 01:34:05,269
I guess things
get real simple.

963
01:34:05,511 --> 01:34:09,971
Jake, thanks.
I'm getting all emotional.

964
01:34:10,082 --> 01:34:12,880
I might just give you
a big wet kiss.

965
01:34:19,691 --> 01:34:23,024
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

966
01:34:23,962 --> 01:34:25,953
I'll drive them out with gas first.

967
01:34:27,699 --> 01:34:29,257
It'll be humane.

968
01:34:30,903 --> 01:34:31,870
More or less.

969
01:34:34,072 --> 01:34:35,903
All right, let's pull the trigger.

970
01:34:39,545 --> 01:34:41,445
Come on, people.
Man.

971
01:34:41,547 --> 01:34:43,242
Let's pack it up, let's go.

972
01:34:43,348 --> 01:34:45,179
This is how it's done.

973
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:51,485
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

974
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:53,182
you make them your enemy.

975
01:34:53,292 --> 01:34:55,624
Then you're justified in taking it.

976
01:34:55,727 --> 01:34:57,752
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.

977
01:34:57,863 --> 01:34:58,852
He's gonna hit Hometree.

978
01:34:59,298 --> 01:35:00,287
My God.

979
01:35:06,605 --> 01:35:09,699
Dr. Augustine!
You cannot be up here!

980
01:35:09,808 --> 01:35:10,775
Back off!

981
01:35:10,876 --> 01:35:14,573
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to...

982
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,738
No. No, no, no, no.
I said back off!

983
01:35:15,847 --> 01:35:19,248
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

984
01:35:19,351 --> 01:35:20,409
All right?
Look around!

985
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,816
I don't know about you, but I see
a lot of trees! They can move!

986
01:35:24,923 --> 01:35:26,356
Can you guys just please...
Yes, sir.

987
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:28,949
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

988
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:30,323
Are you gonna
kill children?

989
01:35:30,429 --> 01:35:34,331
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

990
01:35:34,433 --> 01:35:36,799
Just let me try
to talk them out.

991
01:35:37,636 --> 01:35:39,103
They trust me.

992
01:35:42,407 --> 01:35:44,807
Calibrate fast.
We're going in, right now.

993
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:46,810
Calibrating 3 and 4.

994
01:35:46,912 --> 01:35:47,901
Run sequence.

995
01:35:48,013 --> 01:35:49,844
Initiating. 30 seconds.

996
01:35:54,253 --> 01:35:55,948
Listen to me.
You've got 1 hour.

997
01:35:56,054 --> 01:35:58,614
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

998
01:35:58,724 --> 01:36:01,318
you get them to evacuate.
1 hour.

999
01:36:28,787 --> 01:36:30,186
Look, tell them they're gonna
be here soon.

1000
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:35,521
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

1001
01:36:35,627 --> 01:36:37,561
Are you certain of this?

1002
01:36:41,366 --> 01:36:45,029
Look, they sent me here
to learn your ways

1003
01:36:46,271 --> 01:36:49,502
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

1004
01:36:52,077 --> 01:36:55,672
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

1005
01:36:58,917 --> 01:36:59,906
Yes.

1006
01:37:00,485 --> 01:37:02,885
Look, at first
it was just orders,

1007
01:37:04,423 --> 01:37:06,721
and then
everything changed.

1008
01:37:06,825 --> 01:37:08,588
Okay? I fell in love.

1009
01:37:09,261 --> 01:37:12,708
I fell in love with the forest

1010
01:37:13,001 --> 01:37:15,028
and with the Omaticaya people.

1011
01:37:15,734 --> 01:37:17,167
And with you.

1012
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,967
I trusted you.
With you. With you.

1013
01:37:20,072 --> 01:37:21,471
I trusted you!

1014
01:37:21,573 --> 01:37:22,870
Trust me now, please.

1015
01:37:30,315 --> 01:37:32,715
You will never be
one of The People!

1016
01:37:32,818 --> 01:37:34,581
I shouldn't have...
We tried to stop them!

1017
01:37:34,686 --> 01:37:36,620
Neytiri, please!
Please.

1018
01:37:45,731 --> 01:37:49,030
You have to go.
They're coming!

1019
01:38:02,914 --> 01:38:05,075
<i>Time on target, 1 mike.</i>

1020
01:38:05,183 --> 01:38:07,117
<i>Copy. We have a visual.</i>

1021
01:38:07,219 --> 01:38:10,211
<i>Roger that.
Stay on heading 030.</i>

1022
01:38:10,322 --> 01:38:11,653
<i>Roger, 030.</i>

1023
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,437
Run to the forest!

1024
01:38:26,538 --> 01:38:27,505
They're coming!

1025
01:38:29,141 --> 01:38:30,699
They will destroy this place.

1026
01:38:30,809 --> 01:38:32,606
Neytiri, you must go now!

1027
01:38:36,748 --> 01:38:39,012
Run to the forest!
Run!

1028
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:42,409
Run! Run!

1029
01:39:03,275 --> 01:39:06,403
No! God damn it, run!

1030
01:39:14,619 --> 01:39:16,484
That is one big damn tree.

1031
01:39:24,329 --> 01:39:28,493
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1032
01:39:30,502 --> 01:39:32,561
All right, people,
let's get this done!

1033
01:39:32,671 --> 01:39:35,504
I want every gas round
you got right in the front door.

1034
01:39:35,607 --> 01:39:37,598
<i>Roger.
CS .40's going hot.</i>

1035
01:39:38,009 --> 01:39:39,169
Fire.
Firing.

1036
01:39:50,655 --> 01:39:52,646
Bingo.
Mighty good shooting, ace.

1037
01:40:00,632 --> 01:40:02,224
Sir, they've
opened fire.

1038
01:40:04,169 --> 01:40:05,864
You've got to be kidding me!

1039
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:20,941
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

1040
01:40:21,052 --> 01:40:22,713
All right,
let's turn up the heat.

1041
01:40:22,821 --> 01:40:24,015
Switch incendiaries!

1042
01:40:24,122 --> 01:40:25,714
Switching incendiaries.

1043
01:40:25,824 --> 01:40:26,882
Fire.

1044
01:40:30,228 --> 01:40:31,252
No!

1045
01:40:49,681 --> 01:40:51,842
And that's how
you scatter the roaches.

1046
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:56,814
Neytiri!

1047
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:07,794
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

1048
01:41:08,633 --> 01:41:09,895
My God!

1049
01:41:28,486 --> 01:41:30,147
Mo'at! No!

1050
01:41:30,255 --> 01:41:31,813
If you are one of us,

1051
01:41:33,358 --> 01:41:34,689
help us.

1052
01:41:42,467 --> 01:41:44,230
All call signs, switch missiles.

1053
01:41:44,636 --> 01:41:47,036
<i>Give me HE's at the base
of the west columns.</i>

1054
01:41:49,007 --> 01:41:50,235
This way!

1055
01:41:51,409 --> 01:41:53,240
<i>Rider section, switch missiles.</i>

1056
01:41:53,345 --> 01:41:55,210
<i>One's good.
2's rocks up.</i>

1057
01:41:55,313 --> 01:41:56,302
<i>3's up.</i>

1058
01:41:56,414 --> 01:41:57,904
<i>Yeah, baby, get some!</i>

1059
01:41:58,483 --> 01:42:00,713
<i>Charlie Oscar,
Gunrunner standing by.</i>

1060
01:42:00,819 --> 01:42:02,184
Bring it down. Cleared hot.

1061
01:42:09,294 --> 01:42:10,818
Come on, Grace, move!

1062
01:42:13,498 --> 01:42:15,056
Down! Head down!

1063
01:42:17,669 --> 01:42:19,864
Come on, come on! Down!

1064
01:42:24,676 --> 01:42:26,644
<i>Solid hits.
Solid rocks on target.</i>

1065
01:42:26,745 --> 01:42:27,905
Screw this.

1066
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:31,148
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

1067
01:42:31,249 --> 01:42:33,012
I didn't sign up
for this shit!

1068
01:42:42,727 --> 01:42:44,558
<i>Repeat. Ripple fire.</i>

1069
01:43:28,173 --> 01:43:29,663
Go! Go! Go!

1070
01:44:02,807 --> 01:44:05,241
No, no, get back!
Back!

1071
01:44:24,295 --> 01:44:26,820
Come on!
Come on, move! Move!

1072
01:45:11,876 --> 01:45:15,471
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1073
01:45:16,181 --> 01:45:17,409
Let's boogie.

1074
01:45:17,849 --> 01:45:20,215
<i>Dragon coming left, heading home.</i>

1075
01:45:20,718 --> 01:45:22,618
<i>Gunrunner coming left.</i>

1076
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,211
<i>Thunder copies.
Rider section copies.</i>

1077
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:13,564
Neytiri!

1078
01:46:23,648 --> 01:46:25,377
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1079
01:46:25,483 --> 01:46:27,348
Get away.

1080
01:46:28,052 --> 01:46:29,280
Get away!

1081
01:46:30,421 --> 01:46:32,116
Get away from here!

1082
01:46:33,625 --> 01:46:35,183
Never come back!

1083
01:46:52,911 --> 01:46:54,003
Pull the plug.

1084
01:46:55,013 --> 01:46:56,207
No, you can't do that!

1085
01:46:56,314 --> 01:46:57,611
You can't do that!

1086
01:46:57,715 --> 01:46:59,649
Calm down! Calm down!
No! Please!

1087
01:47:15,867 --> 01:47:18,392
I was a warrior who dreamed
he could bring peace.

1088
01:47:19,837 --> 01:47:23,705
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

1089
01:47:26,544 --> 01:47:27,511
Let's go!

1090
01:47:35,853 --> 01:47:36,945
Put him down!

1091
01:47:40,825 --> 01:47:43,521
You murderer!

1092
01:48:30,208 --> 01:48:32,267
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1093
01:48:32,377 --> 01:48:33,401
Hey.

1094
01:48:34,812 --> 01:48:37,474
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1095
01:48:37,582 --> 01:48:40,380
They get steak?
That's bullshit. Let me see that.

1096
01:48:41,986 --> 01:48:44,079
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1097
01:48:44,589 --> 01:48:45,556
Trudy!

1098
01:48:45,723 --> 01:48:47,088
All the way down.

1099
01:48:50,528 --> 01:48:51,722
Max!

1100
01:49:01,806 --> 01:49:04,297
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1101
01:49:04,909 --> 01:49:05,967
Here.

1102
01:49:18,089 --> 01:49:19,386
Clear. Come on.

1103
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:20,514
Here you go.

1104
01:49:36,107 --> 01:49:39,975
Max, stay here. I need someone
on the inside I can trust.

1105
01:49:40,078 --> 01:49:41,306
Okay. Go.

1106
01:49:55,159 --> 01:49:56,285
Clear.

1107
01:49:58,296 --> 01:49:59,490
Come on, baby.

1108
01:49:59,597 --> 01:50:02,361
Colonel? Sir?
I got a situation here.

1109
01:50:06,003 --> 01:50:08,995
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1110
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:13,338
3!

1111
01:50:16,214 --> 01:50:17,408
Come on!

1112
01:50:19,417 --> 01:50:20,714
Mask on!

1113
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:25,118
Gas, gas, gas!

1114
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:28,782
I'm taking fire!
Let's go!

1115
01:50:31,295 --> 01:50:34,128
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1116
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:37,196
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go!

1117
01:50:49,881 --> 01:50:51,178
Colonel!

1118
01:50:57,955 --> 01:50:59,115
Yeah! Yeah!

1119
01:50:59,223 --> 01:51:00,952
All right! Yes!

1120
01:51:04,695 --> 01:51:05,684
Crap.

1121
01:51:05,796 --> 01:51:07,320
Everybody all right back there?

1122
01:51:07,431 --> 01:51:08,898
Yeah, baby!

1123
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:09,967
Norm, you good?

1124
01:51:10,067 --> 01:51:11,125
Yeah!

1125
01:51:11,769 --> 01:51:14,067
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1126
01:51:14,372 --> 01:51:16,135
Grace is hit!
What?

1127
01:51:17,308 --> 01:51:18,866
Get the trauma kit.
Trauma kit!

1128
01:51:18,976 --> 01:51:20,204
Keep the pressure on,
Grace.

1129
01:51:20,311 --> 01:51:21,972
Trauma kit's forward,
on the bulkhead.

1130
01:51:22,547 --> 01:51:23,844
Hang on, Grace.

1131
01:51:23,948 --> 01:51:27,008
Doesn't matter.
It's fine.

1132
01:51:30,388 --> 01:51:31,616
<i>You're good to go.</i>

1133
01:51:31,722 --> 01:51:32,814
Take it up!

1134
01:51:34,025 --> 01:51:35,822
<i>Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.</i>

1135
01:51:40,264 --> 01:51:41,697
You're clear!

1136
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:52,370
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1137
01:51:52,476 --> 01:51:53,875
Copy that.

1138
01:52:00,885 --> 01:52:02,352
Norm, you all good up there?

1139
01:52:02,453 --> 01:52:04,148
Yep! Still here.

1140
01:52:06,057 --> 01:52:10,255
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

1141
01:52:10,795 --> 01:52:12,820
It's strongest at the
Tree of Souls, right?

1142
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:14,397
Yeah.

1143
01:52:14,498 --> 01:52:15,988
Good. 'Cause that's
where we're going.

1144
01:52:25,309 --> 01:52:26,435
Ouch.

1145
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:31,279
You big baby.

1146
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:34,083
We're moving.

1147
01:52:34,652 --> 01:52:36,677
I'm gonna get you
some help, Grace.

1148
01:52:37,655 --> 01:52:39,782
I'm a scientist, remember?

1149
01:52:40,758 --> 01:52:43,158
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1150
01:52:44,028 --> 01:52:45,928
The People can help you.

1151
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:47,692
I know it.

1152
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:51,565
Why would they help us?

1153
01:53:07,618 --> 01:53:10,678
The People say Eywa will provide.

1154
01:53:12,657 --> 01:53:15,319
With no home, no hope,

1155
01:53:16,427 --> 01:53:18,554
there was only
one place they could go.

1156
01:53:33,092 --> 01:53:34,252
Link's running.

1157
01:53:34,994 --> 01:53:36,586
What's the plan here, Jake?

1158
01:53:36,696 --> 01:53:38,061
There's no plan.

1159
01:53:39,065 --> 01:53:43,695
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1160
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:46,069
I gotta try.

1161
01:53:48,841 --> 01:53:50,138
Launching.

1162
01:54:11,664 --> 01:54:12,858
Outcast.

1163
01:54:13,666 --> 01:54:14,894
Betrayer.

1164
01:54:16,002 --> 01:54:17,128
Alien.

1165
01:54:18,704 --> 01:54:21,400
I was in the place
the eye does not see.

1166
01:54:32,618 --> 01:54:36,452
I needed their help,
and they needed mine.

1167
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:39,358
But to ever
face them again,

1168
01:54:39,459 --> 01:54:41,723
I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.

1169
01:54:50,503 --> 01:54:53,802
Sometimes your whole life
boils down to one insane move.

1170
01:54:56,609 --> 01:54:58,941
There's something we gotta do.

1171
01:54:59,045 --> 01:55:00,740
You're not gonna like it.

1172
01:55:03,616 --> 01:55:04,640
Yah!

1173
01:55:10,823 --> 01:55:14,589
The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1174
01:55:14,694 --> 01:55:16,321
Nothing attacks him.

1175
01:55:16,863 --> 01:55:18,160
Easy, boy.

1176
01:55:18,631 --> 01:55:20,428
So why would he ever look up?

1177
01:55:21,601 --> 01:55:23,193
But that was just a theory.

1178
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:35,498
Toruk Macto?

1179
01:57:15,348 --> 01:57:16,815
I See you.

1180
01:57:19,952 --> 01:57:21,249
I See you.

1181
01:57:29,562 --> 01:57:31,257
I was afraid, Jake.

1182
01:57:32,698 --> 01:57:34,165
For my people.

1183
01:57:37,236 --> 01:57:38,828
I'm not anymore.

1184
01:58:00,393 --> 01:58:04,625
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior.

1185
01:58:05,498 --> 01:58:06,624
I can't do this without you.

1186
01:58:14,707 --> 01:58:16,072
Toruk Macto,

1187
01:58:23,949 --> 01:58:25,678
I will fly with you.

1188
01:58:28,988 --> 01:58:30,683
My friend is dying.

1189
01:58:33,092 --> 01:58:34,616
Grace is dying.

1190
01:58:36,629 --> 01:58:38,494
I beg the help of Eywa.

1191
01:58:50,409 --> 01:58:51,501
Look where we are, Grace.

1192
01:58:59,118 --> 01:59:01,450
I need to take some samples.

1193
01:59:24,944 --> 01:59:29,005
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1194
01:59:30,249 --> 01:59:31,682
in this body.

1195
01:59:34,253 --> 01:59:35,618
Is that possible?

1196
01:59:35,988 --> 01:59:40,448
She must pass through
the eye of Eywa and return.

1197
01:59:41,761 --> 01:59:43,251
But, Jakesully,

1198
01:59:44,296 --> 01:59:45,490
she is very weak.

1199
01:59:47,399 --> 01:59:50,197
Hang on, Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.

1200
02:00:46,425 --> 02:00:47,483
Jake.

1201
02:00:49,962 --> 02:00:51,088
Grace.

1202
02:00:53,232 --> 02:00:54,927
I'm with her, Jake.

1203
02:00:56,969 --> 02:00:58,300
She's real!

1204
02:01:01,373 --> 02:01:04,501
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1205
02:01:05,711 --> 02:01:07,303
What's happening?

1206
02:01:08,314 --> 02:01:09,906
What's happening?

1207
02:01:14,286 --> 02:01:15,412
Grace!

1208
02:01:16,188 --> 02:01:17,314
Grace!

1209
02:01:19,425 --> 02:01:21,017
What's happening?

1210
02:01:27,333 --> 02:01:28,698
Did it work?

1211
02:01:34,406 --> 02:01:38,433
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1212
02:01:40,145 --> 02:01:41,271
She is with Eywa now.

1213
02:02:15,681 --> 02:02:18,343
With your permission,
I will speak now.

1214
02:02:20,753 --> 02:02:23,153
You would honor me
by translating.

1215
02:02:30,296 --> 02:02:32,355
The Sky People
have sent us a message

1216
02:02:35,901 --> 02:02:38,267
that they can take
whatever they want

1217
02:02:40,105 --> 02:02:41,868
and no one can stop them.

1218
02:02:45,477 --> 02:02:47,240
Well, we will send them
a message.

1219
02:02:49,882 --> 02:02:52,214
You ride out as fast as
the wind can carry you.

1220
02:02:55,521 --> 02:02:57,887
You tell the other clans
to come.

1221
02:03:01,026 --> 02:03:03,494
You tell them Toruk Macto
calls to them.

1222
02:03:05,731 --> 02:03:08,495
And you fly now
with me!

1223
02:03:09,568 --> 02:03:12,036
My brothers!
Sisters!

1224
02:03:13,305 --> 02:03:15,364
And we will show
the Sky People

1225
02:03:16,275 --> 02:03:18,106
that they cannot take
whatever they want,

1226
02:03:19,645 --> 02:03:21,044
and that this,

1227
02:03:21,814 --> 02:03:22,803
this is our land!

1228
02:03:29,955 --> 02:03:31,354
Yah!

1229
02:03:46,505 --> 02:03:47,870
Yah!

1230
02:04:17,302 --> 02:04:18,462
Yah!

1231
02:04:36,221 --> 02:04:37,688
We rode out to the 4 winds.

1232
02:04:40,459 --> 02:04:42,859
To the horse clans
of the plain.

1233
02:04:45,864 --> 02:04:46,853
Back to the stars!

1234
02:04:46,965 --> 02:04:49,126
To the ikran people
of the Eastern Sea.

1235
02:04:49,234 --> 02:04:50,496
For our children's children!

1236
02:04:50,602 --> 02:04:53,127
When Toruk Macto
called them, they came.

1237
02:04:57,009 --> 02:04:58,374
Yah!

1238
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:37,048
Everyone on this base,
every one of you,

1239
02:05:37,149 --> 02:05:38,946
is fighting for survival.

1240
02:05:39,051 --> 02:05:40,518
That's a fact!

1241
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:44,116
There's an aboriginal horde out
there massing for an attack.

1242
02:05:46,258 --> 02:05:50,092
Now, these orbital
images tell me

1243
02:05:50,529 --> 02:05:53,692
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1244
02:05:53,799 --> 02:05:56,324
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1245
02:05:56,935 --> 02:05:58,869
And more are pouring in.

1246
02:06:01,373 --> 02:06:04,774
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1247
02:06:04,877 --> 02:06:07,175
At that point, they will overrun
our perimeter.

1248
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:09,474
Well, that's not
gonna happen!

1249
02:06:11,083 --> 02:06:14,678
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1250
02:06:14,786 --> 02:06:17,152
We will fight
terror with terror.

1251
02:06:21,493 --> 02:06:25,623
Now, the hostiles believe that
this mountain stronghold of theirs

1252
02:06:25,731 --> 02:06:28,063
is protected by their...

1253
02:06:28,167 --> 02:06:29,532
Their deity.

1254
02:06:30,869 --> 02:06:32,894
And when we destroy it,

1255
02:06:33,005 --> 02:06:35,337
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1256
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,932
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks
of this place ever again.

1257
02:06:39,044 --> 02:06:41,672
And that, too, is a fact.

1258
02:06:42,848 --> 02:06:44,247
Yeah! Yeah.

1259
02:06:54,693 --> 02:06:56,820
<i>Jake, it's crazy here.
It's full mobilization.</i>

1260
02:06:56,929 --> 02:06:58,624
<i>They're rigging the shuttle
as a bomber.</i>

1261
02:06:58,730 --> 02:07:00,960
<i>They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives.</i>

1262
02:07:01,066 --> 02:07:03,967
<i>It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign.</i>

1263
02:07:04,069 --> 02:07:05,934
Fricking daisy cutters!

1264
02:07:07,506 --> 02:07:10,304
<i>Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.</i>

1265
02:07:10,409 --> 02:07:12,476
When?
0600 tomorrow.

1266
02:07:12,578 --> 02:07:13,875
<i>Max! Max! I gotta go.</i>

1267
02:07:16,315 --> 02:07:17,782
We're screwed!

1268
02:07:19,284 --> 02:07:21,445
And I was hoping for
some sort of tactical plan

1269
02:07:21,553 --> 02:07:23,748
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1270
02:07:25,257 --> 02:07:28,590
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1271
02:07:31,630 --> 02:07:33,621
I have 15 clans out there.

1272
02:07:34,366 --> 02:07:35,765
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1273
02:07:37,970 --> 02:07:39,369
Now, we know these mountains.

1274
02:07:39,471 --> 02:07:42,406
We fly them. You fly them.
They don't.

1275
02:07:43,475 --> 02:07:45,272
Their instruments
won't work up here.

1276
02:07:45,377 --> 02:07:47,504
Missile tracking
won't work.

1277
02:07:48,013 --> 02:07:49,503
They'll have to fire
a line of sight.

1278
02:07:49,615 --> 02:07:51,879
If they bring
the fight to us,

1279
02:07:51,984 --> 02:07:53,281
then we have the home-field
advantage.

1280
02:07:55,754 --> 02:07:57,381
You know he's gonna
commit that bomber

1281
02:07:57,489 --> 02:07:58,615
straight to
the Tree of Souls.

1282
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:00,451
Yeah, I know.

1283
02:08:00,559 --> 02:08:03,050
If they get to the Tree of Souls,
it's over.

1284
02:08:03,161 --> 02:08:06,324
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1285
02:08:07,165 --> 02:08:09,133
It'll destroy them.

1286
02:08:09,234 --> 02:08:11,634
Then I guess
we'd better stop him.

1287
02:08:26,752 --> 02:08:29,721
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1288
02:08:32,157 --> 02:08:36,890
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

1289
02:08:39,464 --> 02:08:43,833
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

1290
02:08:45,137 --> 02:08:47,196
See the world
we come from.

1291
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:50,205
There's no green there.

1292
02:08:51,643 --> 02:08:53,611
They killed their Mother.

1293
02:08:54,413 --> 02:08:56,881
And they're gonna do
the same here.

1294
02:08:58,550 --> 02:09:01,110
More Sky People
are gonna come.

1295
02:09:01,219 --> 02:09:04,245
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1296
02:09:05,557 --> 02:09:07,286
Unless we stop them.

1297
02:09:09,895 --> 02:09:12,955
Look, you chose me
for something.

1298
02:09:14,433 --> 02:09:16,298
I will stand and fight.

1299
02:09:17,369 --> 02:09:18,927
You know I will.

1300
02:09:21,473 --> 02:09:23,668
But I need a little help here.

1301
02:09:29,848 --> 02:09:32,840
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1302
02:09:34,686 --> 02:09:38,087
She protects only
the balance of life.

1303
02:09:49,935 --> 02:09:51,630
It was worth a try.

1304
02:10:22,334 --> 02:10:24,302
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

1305
02:10:24,403 --> 02:10:27,736
Yeah! Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about, man!

1306
02:10:39,851 --> 02:10:43,218
<i>This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.</i>

1307
02:10:43,622 --> 02:10:45,249
<i>Switch to manual flight mode.</i>

1308
02:10:45,357 --> 02:10:47,154
Copy. Manual flight mode.

1309
02:11:22,127 --> 02:11:23,958
This is Papa Dragon.

1310
02:11:24,062 --> 02:11:25,620
I want this mission
high and tight.

1311
02:11:25,730 --> 02:11:27,129
I want to be home for dinner.

1312
02:11:34,673 --> 02:11:35,799
Suit Team, go.

1313
02:11:35,907 --> 02:11:38,398
All right, ladies,
let's bring the pain!

1314
02:11:48,987 --> 02:11:50,579
Move, move, move!

1315
02:11:56,228 --> 02:11:57,991
Bravo 1-1, move left.

1316
02:11:58,563 --> 02:12:01,964
Bravo 1-1 moving left.
Watch flank.

1317
02:12:04,336 --> 02:12:06,736
Watch formation.
Keep moving.

1318
02:12:06,838 --> 02:12:07,862
Roger that.

1319
02:12:07,973 --> 02:12:10,339
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

1320
02:12:10,442 --> 02:12:11,739
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

1321
02:12:11,843 --> 02:12:16,507
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

1322
02:12:17,148 --> 02:12:20,413
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target.

1323
02:12:20,519 --> 02:12:22,919
<i>Escorts, stay close
on my shuttle.</i>

1324
02:12:28,059 --> 02:12:30,550
We are gonna lose
some paint in here.

1325
02:12:31,563 --> 02:12:34,123
<i>Gun crews,
keep your head on a swivel.</i>

1326
02:12:34,266 --> 02:12:37,167
<i>Make no mistake, people,
they're out there.</i>

1327
02:12:38,770 --> 02:12:42,001
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, 4 klicks.

1328
02:12:42,107 --> 02:12:44,302
Valkyrie 1-6,
get your payload ready.

1329
02:12:44,476 --> 02:12:45,636
Copy. Prepare to offload.

1330
02:12:45,744 --> 02:12:46,904
Staff Sergeant,
stage the weapon.

1331
02:12:47,746 --> 02:12:49,941
Roll it to the ramp!
Let's go!

1332
02:12:52,217 --> 02:12:53,275
Hold!

1333
02:13:01,293 --> 02:13:03,318
<i>Charlie 2-1, got big movement.</i>

1334
02:13:03,428 --> 02:13:04,827
Hold position.
Hold up, hold up.

1335
02:13:04,930 --> 02:13:06,898
<i>We got movement
out there, 500 meters.</i>

1336
02:13:06,998 --> 02:13:08,898
Charlie 2-1, hold position.

1337
02:13:15,206 --> 02:13:18,107
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

1338
02:13:18,209 --> 02:13:19,642
<i>Charlie Oscar, Rider section.</i>

1339
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:20,733
<i>Firing line!</i>

1340
02:13:21,179 --> 02:13:23,841
<i>Targets closing.
Range, 400 meters.</i>

1341
02:13:24,583 --> 02:13:26,016
Can't you clean it up?

1342
02:13:26,117 --> 02:13:27,277
No, sir.
It's the Flux.

1343
02:13:55,614 --> 02:13:56,638
Brother, I'm gonna
punch a hole.

1344
02:13:56,748 --> 02:13:58,238
You follow me through.

1345
02:14:40,025 --> 02:14:42,755
All aircraft, weapons free!
Weapons free!

1346
02:14:43,895 --> 02:14:45,089
Break right. Come around.

1347
02:14:48,667 --> 02:14:50,134
Light them up!

1348
02:14:57,809 --> 02:14:59,970
Break formation,
engage all hostiles.

1349
02:15:07,252 --> 02:15:09,117
Yeah! Get some!

1350
02:15:48,159 --> 02:15:49,922
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1351
02:16:00,805 --> 02:16:02,568
Jake! Jake!
You copy?

1352
02:16:03,274 --> 02:16:05,970
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1353
02:16:06,077 --> 02:16:07,044
Copy.
Get out of there.

1354
02:16:12,183 --> 02:16:13,548
That's him. Get after him!

1355
02:16:30,535 --> 02:16:31,502
Take him out!

1356
02:16:40,311 --> 02:16:41,300
Light her up!

1357
02:16:50,789 --> 02:16:52,154
Right there!

1358
02:16:52,323 --> 02:16:54,553
You're not the only one
with a gun, bitch.

1359
02:16:54,826 --> 02:16:56,453
Keep her in your sights.
Purging. Feeding the leak.

1360
02:16:56,561 --> 02:16:57,585
Arming all pods.

1361
02:17:03,334 --> 02:17:04,392
That's it!

1362
02:17:35,099 --> 02:17:36,157
Seze!

1363
02:18:40,164 --> 02:18:42,325
<i>Rogue 1 is hit.
I'm going in.</i>

1364
02:18:43,234 --> 02:18:44,599
Sorry, Jake.

1365
02:18:53,478 --> 02:18:54,536
Fire.

1366
02:19:12,664 --> 02:19:15,155
Tsu'tey!
Brother, do you read?

1367
02:19:18,002 --> 02:19:19,629
Rogue 1, you copy?

1368
02:19:21,673 --> 02:19:22,799
Trudy!

1369
02:19:33,751 --> 02:19:35,013
Time to target, 2 minutes.

1370
02:19:35,353 --> 02:19:37,753
Valkyrie 1-6,
you are cleared and hot.

1371
02:19:37,855 --> 02:19:40,016
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1372
02:19:45,863 --> 02:19:47,262
Arm number 1!

1373
02:19:48,499 --> 02:19:49,830
Number 1 armed!

1374
02:19:51,135 --> 02:19:52,329
Ma Jake!

1375
02:19:54,272 --> 02:19:55,398
I read you.

1376
02:20:04,549 --> 02:20:05,573
Neytiri!

1377
02:20:05,683 --> 02:20:06,707
Seze's dead.

1378
02:20:07,151 --> 02:20:09,619
They are very close.
They are many.

1379
02:20:11,055 --> 02:20:12,522
Do not attack.

1380
02:20:13,157 --> 02:20:15,091
<i>Do you read me, Neytiri?</i>

1381
02:20:17,695 --> 02:20:18,957
Do not attack!

1382
02:20:19,330 --> 02:20:22,458
<i>Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!</i>

1383
02:20:30,575 --> 02:20:31,769
Neytiri!

1384
02:20:33,878 --> 02:20:35,778
I got movement.

1385
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:37,677
Hold position.
Something's coming.

1386
02:20:37,782 --> 02:20:40,012
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over.

1387
02:20:40,118 --> 02:20:42,207
We got movement 200 meters.
Hold your formation.

1388
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:44,015
Be ready.
Watch your flanks.

1389
02:20:49,193 --> 02:20:50,660
<i>Hundred meters and closing fast.</i>

1390
02:21:07,245 --> 02:21:09,213
We gotta get out of here!

1391
02:21:10,748 --> 02:21:12,443
Fall back! Fall back!
Move!

1392
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:14,950
<i>Fall back!
On the run! On the run!</i>

1393
02:21:22,093 --> 02:21:24,755
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1394
02:21:31,669 --> 02:21:33,398
Eywa has heard you!

1395
02:21:44,015 --> 02:21:45,380
Come on!

1396
02:21:57,695 --> 02:21:59,526
Fall back!
Move! Move!

1397
02:22:24,055 --> 02:22:26,649
Sir! All escorts are down
or falling back.

1398
02:22:26,757 --> 02:22:30,853
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1399
02:22:30,962 --> 02:22:32,623
Press to target.

1400
02:22:32,730 --> 02:22:33,788
Copy. Pressing to target.

1401
02:22:33,898 --> 02:22:35,889
Stand by to drop,
30 seconds.

1402
02:22:55,753 --> 02:22:58,153
On my mark.
2, 1, mark.

1403
02:22:58,256 --> 02:23:00,952
Drop! Drop! Drop!
Go, go, go!

1404
02:23:34,725 --> 02:23:35,851
Brace!

1405
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:53,877
It's Sully.

1406
02:24:07,992 --> 02:24:09,016
Mask on!

1407
02:24:09,126 --> 02:24:10,218
Breach alarm!

1408
02:26:47,485 --> 02:26:49,146
Come on.
Come to papa.

1409
02:27:16,814 --> 02:27:18,577
Give it up, Quaritch!

1410
02:27:21,652 --> 02:27:23,119
It's all over.

1411
02:27:24,422 --> 02:27:26,356
Nothing's over
while I'm breathing.

1412
02:27:26,957 --> 02:27:28,948
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1413
02:28:25,349 --> 02:28:26,543
Come on!

1414
02:28:42,466 --> 02:28:46,527
Hey, Sully, how's it feel
to betray your own race?

1415
02:28:51,208 --> 02:28:53,369
You think you're one of them?

1416
02:28:54,645 --> 02:28:56,237
Time to wake up.

1417
02:30:40,484 --> 02:30:41,508
Jake?

1418
02:30:55,265 --> 02:30:56,323
Jake.

1419
02:31:14,385 --> 02:31:15,750
Jake.

1420
02:31:31,802 --> 02:31:33,770
Jake! Ma Jake!

1421
02:32:15,446 --> 02:32:16,743
I See you.

1422
02:32:22,453 --> 02:32:23,750
I See you.

1423
02:32:26,830 --> 02:32:32,630
Subtitles: Arigon

1424
02:32:35,365 --> 02:32:38,163
The aliens went back
to their dying world.

1425
02:32:40,370 --> 02:32:43,237
Only a few were chosen to stay.

1426
02:32:55,452 --> 02:32:57,943
The time of great sorrow
was ending.

1427
02:33:00,057 --> 02:33:02,423
Toruk Macto was
no longer needed.

1428
02:33:15,005 --> 02:33:18,873
Well, I guess this is
my last video log.

1429
02:33:20,744 --> 02:33:23,010
'Cause whatever happens tonight,

1430
02:33:23,504 --> 02:33:25,210
either way, I'm...

1431
02:33:25,582 --> 02:33:28,380
I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place.

1432
02:33:32,022 --> 02:33:34,115
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1433
02:33:36,727 --> 02:33:39,753
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party.

1434
02:33:43,133 --> 02:33:45,533
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1435
02:33:48,105 --> 02:33:50,369
This is Jake Sully signing off.

1436
02:35:24,101 --> 02:35:26,001
<i>Walking through a dream</i>

1437
02:35:26,103 --> 02:35:29,732
<i>I see you</i>

1438
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:36,177
<i>My light in darkness
breathing hope of new life</i>

1439
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:40,580
<i>Now I live through you
and you through me</i>

1440
02:35:40,684 --> 02:35:43,016
<i>Enchanting</i>

1441
02:35:43,887 --> 02:35:47,050
<i>I pray in my heart</i>

1442
02:35:47,157 --> 02:35:51,093
<i>That this dream never ends</i>

1443
02:35:51,194 --> 02:35:58,032
<i>I see me through your eyes</i>

1444
02:36:00,137 --> 02:36:07,009
<i>Breathing new life,
flying high</i>

1445
02:36:08,478 --> 02:36:15,350
<i>Your love shines the way
into paradise</i>

1446
02:36:15,452 --> 02:36:19,149
<i>So I offer my life</i>

1447
02:36:19,256 --> 02:36:24,319
<i>I offer my love for you</i>

1448
02:36:24,428 --> 02:36:27,829
<i>And my heart was never open</i>

1449
02:36:27,931 --> 02:36:31,298
<i>And my spirit never free</i>

1450
02:36:31,401 --> 02:36:37,738
<i>To the world
that you have shown me</i>

1451
02:36:38,375 --> 02:36:42,539
<i>But my eyes
could not envision</i>

1452
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:50,552
<i>All the colors of love
and of life evermore</i>

1453
02:36:52,522 --> 02:36:58,290
<i>Evermore</i>

1454
02:37:00,397 --> 02:37:05,960
<i>I see me through your eyes</i>

1455
02:37:06,069 --> 02:37:10,028
<i>Flying high</i>

1456
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:17,069
<i>Your love shines the way
into paradise</i>

1457
02:37:17,180 --> 02:37:23,710
<i>So I offer my life
as a sacrifice</i>

1458
02:37:24,388 --> 02:37:30,520
<i>I live through your love</i>

1459
02:37:31,495 --> 02:37:35,864
<i>I live</i>

1460
02:37:37,334 --> 02:37:41,395
<i>Through your life</i>

1461
02:37:46,009 --> 02:37:51,379
<i>I see you</i>

1462
02:37:53,350 --> 02:38:00,085
<i>I see you</i>
